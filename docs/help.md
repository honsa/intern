# Getting help

# Community support

The Intern community is available to assist you with basic questions, advice,
and general guidance. There are three primary ways to get community support:

- [Post a question to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=intern)
- [Join theintern/intern on Gitter](https://gitter.im/theintern/intern)
- [Join #intern on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=intern)

# Commercial support

Some problems are too complicated, specific, time-sensitive, or confidential to
be solved through free community support. In these cases,
[SitePenâ€™s](https://sitepen.com) commercial development services may be a good
fit for you or your company.
